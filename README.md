# Omniglot---OneShot-Learning---MAML
My implementation of the framework presented in the MAML article by Finn et al. 2017.
The code is finished running with a correct output of 70%, much better than randon and higher then the results prior to learning (10%). 
Still the code could use more work to improve these results.
